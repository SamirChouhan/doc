1) Pool: All queries in MySQL connection are done one after another. It means that if you want to do 10 queries and each query takes 2 seconds then it will take 20 seconds
to complete whole execution.
The solution is to create 10 connection and run each query in a different connection. This can be done automatically using connection pool.
2) Mysql: The mysql2 package is also very popular, but has a few advantages. 
The advantage I care about is support for promises. The authors of this package have actually teamed up with the authors of the mysql package to reduce double efforts, 
and was made to be compatible with mysql so for many people itâ€™s a drop-in replacement.
3) express: Require('express') returns a function reference. that function is called with express() . app is an object returned by express().
4) Body_parser: In order to read HTTP POST data , we have to use "body-parser" node module. body-parser is a piece of express middleware that reads a form's input and
 stores it as a javascript object accessible through req.body
5)CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port)
 other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. 
 CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request.
 In that preflight,the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.
6) Moment: Moment.js is a lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
7) Date-format: Dateformat is similar to Moment in that it formats dates using token strings, but it does so a bit differently. Using the browser version of datetime, 
 it will extend the Date object to have a .format() method.
8) Nodemailer: Nodemailer is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending.
9) Multer: Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.
10) md5: md5 is a javascript function for hashing messages, passwords with MD5. Passwords are saved securely in the myphpadmin db database by hashing the user input with MD5
Encoding password in md5 is the basic encoding and not recommended for the high-security platforms instead of that use SHA256 encoding for the password. 
11) dovnet: Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on
The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
12) urlcoded: urlencoded() function is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with urlencoded payloads and is based on body-parser. 
Parameter: The options parameter contains various property like extended, inflate, limit, verify etc.	
13) app.get("/", function(req, res) {}: You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; 
for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD.
You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function.
14) The req.body property contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body. By default, it is undefined and is populated when you use a middleware called
 body-parsing such as express.urlencoded() or express.json().
15) {var instKey = req.body.key;} A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body). This object will contain key-value pairs,
 where the value can be a string or array (when extended is false), or any type (when extended is true).
16) function NewRow(title,url): Used to add new row in existing table.
17)  if (instKey && key === md5(instKey): If any value between instaKey and key is true. than instaKey will be encoded with md5 method.
18) conn.query: is used to execute the user query and request database to fatch query detail.
19) if (rows.length > 0): If rows length is greater than 0 ,than title will be "dynamic_tab_name" and x = row.content. If x==="" than response will be This institute does not have dynamic button
and status will be {failed}. Else SELECT query will run and establish connection between server and web_dynamic_menu_bar database. After this newRows will be created and data will be stored respectively.
After the data is store we get response newsRows and status will be {successful}.

........................CORE FEACTURE..................................................................................................................................
Core features enable the main purpose that the technology is expected to fulfill the requirement of user.
In core feacture we insert data like feature title, feature detail, feature heading, feature icon etc.
First we gona establish connection between database and server, than insert details of features. Post method is used as request.


......................../get_course_detail/top_courses.................................................................................................................
Course is a unit of teaching that typically lasts one academic term, is led by one or more instructors (teachers or professors), and has a fixed roster of students.
We provide top quality courses. User have to fill various types of field to store his data.

Following are some of the field:
1) Courses Name
2) Courses Slug
3) Courses Details
4) Courses Image
Connection will be establish with web_courses database.

........................Get_notification1..............................................................................................................................
A notification is a message that Android displays outside your app's UI to provide the user with reminders, 
communication from other people, or other timely information from your app.

There are verious field in notification:
1) notify_id
2) notify_title
3) notify_description
4) date
5) image

{conn.query("SELECT * FROM web_notification WHERE inst_hash=? ORDER BY notify_id DESC", id, function(err, rows)} Query is used to establish the connection between the server and database.
1) If query does't execute than output will be {status = "Failed"}.
2) If(rows.length>0) than we enter in another if loop (nasted loop) if(row.notify_date_update === null || row.notify_date_update === "" || row.notify_date_update === '0000-00-00')
if any one of condition is true {row.notify_date_update === null || row.notify_date_update === "" || row.notify_date_update === '0000-00-00'} than {date = row.notify_date} 
or else {date = row.notify_date_update;} date will update.
3) New row will be created with the name of {row.notify_id, row.notify_title, row.notify_description, date,row.image}
{newRows.push(newRow);} will help us to pure and insert the following data.
After successfully insertion we get response {status = "success"}. If not than we get {status = "failed"} And connection will be terminated. 

.......................get_testimonial1..............................................................................................................................
A testimonial is a statement that says how good someone or something is. In testimonial user gone fill some field:
Following are some of the field:
1) first_name
2) last_name
3) image_url
4) description
5) video_url
6) title
If (result.length === 0) and response will be `{"response":{"img_url":""},"status":"failed"}`else array is created {resultarray = []} and data will be stored.
at the end status will be successfull.


.......................get_video1..............................................................................................................................

User will fullfill requirement like:
1) video id 
2)description 
3)video title 
4)video link respectively
Database will be connected through 
conn.query("SELECT * FROM web_video WHERE inst_hash =? ORDER BY video_id DESC", id, function(err, rows) .if (n == 0) than {status = "success"} else(rows.length > 0 && n > 0) 
is true than new row will create and n will decrement (n--).Loop will execute till the condition will satisfied. when (n===0) its false else true. True statement bring
{status = "success"}.

.......................Get_pdf_new1..............................................................................................................................
PDF stands for "portable document format".  Essentially, the format is used when you need to save files that cannot be modified but still need to be easily shared and printed.
